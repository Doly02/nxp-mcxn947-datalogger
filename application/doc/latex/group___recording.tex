Buffer For Multi-\/\+Buffering -\/ In Particular Dual-\/\+Buffering, One Is Always Filled, The Other Is Processed. 

Must Be Aligned on Multiple of 512B, Since SDHC/\+SDXC Card Uses 512-\/Byte Fixed Block Length. The Address of The R/W Buffer Should Be Also Align To The Specific DMA Data Buffer Address Align Value. At The Same Time Buffer Address/\+Size Should Be Aligned To The Cache Line Size.
