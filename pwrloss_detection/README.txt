This folder contains signal records that are relevant to the loss of supply voltage.

- TIMER_State signal indicates when the power loss detection is triggered
- CMP_State signal indicates the comparator's response to power loss 
- V_In signal is the input voltage (5V branch)
- CMP_In signal is the input voltage that the comparator sees on its input
